Martin Nguyen is the developer of [Gestimer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gestimer-for-those-little/id990588172?mt=12): A reminder app that sits in the Mac menu-bar with a fun pull-to-set gesture to add new timers. [http://maddin.io/gestimer/](http://maddin.io/gestimer/).

During Gestimer's launch week, it quickly rose to #1 paid productivity app in the App Store, and continued strong sales throughout the month. I asked Martin to share how he built the app and how he prepared for such a succesful launch.

**Did you major in CS or computer related things in college? When did you start iOS development?**

I studied CS because I thought it would teach me how to make apps for iOS and OS X. Within the first month of starting the course in 2011 I began learning iOS development during my own time and I somehow managed to make a little app without understanding objects or object-oriented programming. All my code was inside a single file.

**Did you stick with your degree and finish? or did you drop out and go straight to work? Now that you’re on the other side - what would you do differently?**

I finished my degree and and in hindsight it was probably the correct decision. It bought me time to think about what my next should step be which fortunately led me to make Gestimer.

**In addition to the extra time, do you think you’re a better equipped iOS developer with that degree, or would you have caught up with out it? I’ve seen lots of discussion by young dev asking if they should pursue CS or just go code-camps and straight into industry as fast as possible. What would you recommend to them?**

I don't believe that having a CS degree has helped much. CS is very theoretical and for me a more practical approach, i.e. writing code is a better approach to learning.

Therefore I believe that going straight into industry is the better path as you immediately specialize and learn the tools and programming languages that interest you.

**I’m sure you’ve had tons of app ideas over the years - how did you narrow them down and decide on Gestimer?**

Gestimer was one of those ideas that just kept coming back me. There were so many occasions where I wished the app existed so I could simply drag & drop and be done, but instead I had to use something else that wasn't as effortless. Making Gestimer was an easy decision as I knew that I would use it all the time.

**Did you do any research before you started building? or did you just dive right in?**

I did do some research because I wasn't sure how to get started with the drag & drop interface in the menubar. I wasn't aware of any other apps like Gestimer to see if my idea was possible. It's very different when you try searching solutions for OS X problems because there isn't as much information available compared to iOS.

Other than that there wasn't any other research. I didn't validate the idea to find potential customers or anything similar. I knew that I would use the app and that's all I cared about.

**How long did it take, from the first idea to being live in the app store?**

I got the idea for Gestimer in 2012 and there were multiple attempts trying to get something working. I shelved the project many times. It was only in the summer of 2014 when I made some real progress and after a couple months the app was pretty much done. I was happy with the result and was able to use it for my own purposes. I didn't put the app on the App Store until June 2015, so almost another year went by after the first working version before I released it.

**Did you ever second guess yourself about the app? if so, what made you keep going? if not, did anything in particular help keep your focus and motivation?**

There was never any second guessing as Gestimer is an app I made just for myself. I knew it would be useful to me and that's all that mattered.

After attempting to make Gestimer so many times it was easy to continue once I found more and more of the missing pieces. The implementation proved to be exactly what I wanted and it was fun to use. From then on I simply kept working on the app until I was satisfied with the results.

I did wonder how Gestimer would be perceived by others. On the one hand I thought that the UI was great for the task but on the other hand it's just drag & drop. I was worried that some people dismiss the app as being too simple rather than see how its simplicity is its greatest strength.

**How long before launch did you start thinking about marketing your app?**

Since I made the app for myself and was happily using it already, there was no rush to release it to the public. Marketing was an afterthought and I didn't plan ahead when I would launch the app. Someday I simply decided that I wanted to release Gestimer and slowly started working on the website, video, etc. It was about 2 months before launch day when I started working on the marketing aspect.

**That video looks awesome! Did you hire someone to build it for you? Or did you do the whole thing yourself? If you did it yourself, how on earth did you learn to edit something like that with those transitions etc? What tools did you use and how many hours did it take from start to finish?**

I made the video myself but at the time I was unsure if I could even make a product video. I've only edited a video once in high scool using iMovie '06 many years ago. This time I used Final Cut Pro so I had to spend some time learning the basics of that. The transitions and animations were made in Keynote which is something I am very familiar with. All together I probably spent about a week on it. I'm glad it turned out well and it was very fun to work on! I wish I had the opportunity to work on something like that more often.

**When you put up your teaser site, did you do anything to try and drive traffic to it? did you collect email addresses - if so how many did you get before launch?**

I posted the teaser site to Twitter, Hacker News and Reddit. Twitter was the most successful in driving traffic as there were a lot of designers who liked Gestimer's UX and tweeted about it. By launch I had close to 400 email subscribers.

**How did you approach marketing Gestimer for launch?**

The very first thing I had prepared was a landing webpage that showed a short clip of the app with an email form. The same clip is still on the [current website](http://maddin.io/gestimer/) and I believe it does a good job of showing Gestimer's interaction. It's short and straight to the point. The goal was to gather more opinions and find some testers to improve the app further before launch as well as have an email list for launch day.
Similarly, I posted a link to the landing page from [@GestimerApp](https://twitter.com/gestimerapp) to start gaining some followers.

Choosing a launch day was difficult. There's always the danger that something else might launch on the same day or that there might be other major tech news you can't predict. I decided to launch on a Friday because I thought that people would then have time to read and hear about Gestimer over the weekend when they aren't as busy with their jobs. It's probably better to launch on a Tuesday or Wednesday as weekends are very quiet.

Once I decided on the date I updated the website and announced it on Twitter and the email list. I started contacting a number of websites via email and a few people on Twitter. Maybe it was my pitch but I didn't get any replies as far as I can remember and there was only one website (they approached me) that had a review ready on launch day. I didn't expect much for my little app anyway so I was not really disappointed. For launch day I again had a website prepared. It contained more information, screenshots, a product video, a press kit, and the download link.

When it was time to launch I posted Gestimer to [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/tech/gestimer), sent out emails to people in the email list, and used Twitter to spread the word. For the tweet I made a Vine clip similar to the short clip on the website as it would be look nicer and be playable in the Twitter timeline. Most attention however was gained shortly after launch as suddenly more and more websites started posting about Gestimer.

As the app climbed the charts, I kept emailing a couple more websites as well as trying a second time for websites who did not reply previously. I changed my pitch to try out a different approach. Shorter pitches seem to be much preferred. In the end, Gestimer reached #1 Top Paid on the Mac App Store in many countries so it was quite a success for my first Mac app.

**How did you compile the list of sites to email, and who did you email? the general contact page email or did you find specific people to email? How long did it take, etc, what was that process like?**

I used [submit.co](http://submit.co) which I discovered through Product Hunt. It provides a large list of sites that you can contact for press coverage. I picked out sites that have done OS X app reviews and emailed the reviewers who wrote those reviews.
You should avoid the general contact page as much as you can. Sometimes I contacted people on Twitter if I couldn't find their email on the website.

Writing and sending out the emails was very time consuming. I didn't want to send the same email to everyone and tried out different pitches to test out what works and what doesn't. I found that shorter emails are more generally more effective but there are few people who want all the details in the email.

It seems like you did lots of little things on launch day - product hunt, emails, tweets w/ video, etc etc. How much of that did you prepare before hand? or did you post where you could as you thought about it?

I definitely came prepared. I knew at time to post to Product Hunt so that my submission wouldn't be on the previous day's list, I had the email to subscribers prepared, I had a Vine account ready for posting the tweet, and the product video was already uploaded to YouTube several days before but unlisted. I wanted the launch day to be as smooth as possible.

**Do you have stats on downloads / day during those first days and weeks? Hitting #1 Top Paid is /huge/ - i know tons of dev would love that! I also know that launch day is typically a spike and plateaus soon after - what were those stats like for you?**

During the first 31 days Gestimer made $10k (after Apple's cut) which equals to nearly 5k downloads. That was an average of over 150 downloads per day. There were a few download spikes here and there but after the first 60 days downloads have averaged at about 8 per day.

**What’s your next step? More updates for Gestimer I presume - have you changed anything about how you approach releases for updates? do you already have plans for a next app? Do you ask for user’s email addresses when they install Gestimer, to try and build a list and give whatever your next app a headstart on its marketing?**

There will be a couple updates but I am actually avoiding adding too many features. I love that it's so simple and that you don't have to spend too much time in the app when you use it, but when you do use it it's fun.

I currently don't have any plans for other apps but I'll most certainly use the help of Gestimer to help promote my next app. I am actually looking for a job right now, because...well, I'm 24 and have never had a proper job. I think it's about time. (My parents are also bugging me about this.)

**If you could change only 1 thing about how you built and / or marketed Gestimer for launch - what would it be?**

I'd change the name. "Gestimer" is a mixture of "gesture" and "timer" and when it was always intended to be a placeholder for a better name. I never took the time to come up with a better name. Unfortunately "Gestimer" gets autocorrected in OS X and iOS. (It's probably still a better name than "Here, File File!" though 😜)

**What is the most important thing you would *not* change?**

The drag & drop UI. It's just a single drag directly from the menu bar. Nothing else. It's so simple and feels perfect.

**Thanks Martin for your insight! And congratulations again on [Gestimer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gestimer-for-those-little/id990588172?mt=12)'s success! You can [download Gestimer here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gestimer-for-those-little/id990588172?mt=12).**
